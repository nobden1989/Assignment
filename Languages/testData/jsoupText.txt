(DAX MELMER/The Windsor Star) Share Comments Email Tweet Pin It Alex Brockman Jun 21, 2015 - 12:10 PM EDT Last Updated: Jun 22, 2015 - 11:32 AM EDT A Windsor mother faces a charge of child abandonment after leaving her three-year-old and one-year-old children in an apartment lobby for hours Saturday morning, Windsor police said. The building’s manager, who declined to give his name, said he first saw the two children sleeping in their stroller as he left for coffee at 7:30 a.m. Saturday. When he came back at 11:30 a.m. he called police. As police responded to his call, the infants were awake in their stroller. While officers investigated, one officer rocked the stroller back and forth, keeping the kids calm. Of all the people at the scene the kids were the only ones smiling and laughing. At the scene, the woman who police identified as the children’s mother received medical attention from paramedics. Staff Sgt. Jeff Mailloux of the Windsor Police said she was taken to hospital and Children’s Aid Services is involved. Police officers carried the kids out of the apartment building into a waiting ambulance, bringing a blanket and a bag of graham crackers with them. Neighbour Yasmin Farah said she saw the kids at 8:30 a.m. and called the woman she believes is the children’s mother who lives in an upstairs apartment. “I called the woman upstairs, and said there’s two kids, why are they there? She said ‘it’s not your business.’” Farah said. “I don’t know who the woman is. Maybe it’s the mother, she said it’s not your business. It is my business. It’s two kids. You’re my neighbour, I see you with the kids before I moved downstairs.” After continuing to call the woman, eventually she came downstairs, Farah said, prompting Farah to go back inside her apartment with her family. She came back out of her apartment after police arrived. “I saw her sit down and watch the kids, but maybe she left the kids again,” said Farah, who only knows the woman to say hello in the  hallways. “I came out and saw the police and was scared.” With files from Dane Wanniarachige Find Windsor Star on Facebook Tags: Crime and Law, Windsor, Windsor Police   Connect With Us Facebook Twitter Google Plus Pinterest Tumblr RSS Most Popular Most Popular Windsor woman pleads guilty to indecent act for library peep shows Motorcyclist killed in North Talbot Road crash Storm sparks blaze, knocks out power in Windsor, Essex County Ford Fireworks’ early start a success Why won’t Ontario invest in Ontario?
